# Contributing to IncludeOS

Feel free to [clone, edit and send pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). 

* Do exactly one thing pr. pull-request. This makes it possible to quickly see and understand what you've done. 
* Please don't redo the folder-structure - if you have suggestions for this, just post an issue explaining the benefits of your suggested structure.
    * Feel free to add subfolders, just give them ... logical names.
* Everything you commit will be under the same license as this repo (Undecided so far) and HiOA will retain the right to publish your commits under a different license.
