# Include OS test service

This is a special "seed" (i.e. something that started as a copy of <repo>/seed) which is supposed to build into an authorative test image for IncludeOS. The goal is that whenever you build the test image, it will tell you everything that's rigth and everything that's wrong with the current IncludeOS build.
